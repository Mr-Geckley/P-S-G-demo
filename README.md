# Peck Scratch Go

Peck Scratch Go is a two-player, tic-tac-toe style game. I was inspired to build this project because my daughter is at the age where tic-tac-toe is the default game we play to avoid boredom in public.
It's convenient to fire up an entertaining alternative without having to fumble with pen and paper. Peck Scratch Go is themed after cats and chickens because we have a lot of both of those at our house and my daughter absolutely adores them.
The application features a user sign-in, randomly generated emojis that correspond to the player's 'team', instead of x's and o's, appropriatly themed celebratory gifs, and an option to change the teams to 'Christmas' and 'Halloween'.

## Getting Started

To experience the fun just grab a friend, go to "https://shielded-fortress-86353.herokuapp.com/", create an account, login, and enjoy! 
Please keep in mind that heroku applications will "go to sleep" after being inactive for a while. So your initial load time will include a call to the server to spin up the application before the page is loaded.
